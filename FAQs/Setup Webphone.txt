1. Admin → Servers (WebSocket URL)
	Go to Admin → Servers.
	Edit the server(s) that run Asterisk (your dialer(s)).
	Set:
	Web socket URL
	Single server: wss://YOUR_DOMAIN:8089/ws
	Cluster (DB+Web + dialers): wss://DIALER_IP_or_HOSTNAME:8089/ws
	External web socket URL (if used): same as above for external access.
	Save.
	The WebSocket must point to the Asterisk host, since that’s where the WebRTC/WebSocket endpoint runs.


2. Admin → System Settings
	Go to Admin → System Settings.
	Set Sounds web server (or similar) to your HTTPS domain, e.g. https://YOUR_DOMAIN.


3. Admin → Phones (SIP_generic template)
	Go to Admin → Phones.
	Edit the SIP_generic (or WebRTC) template.
	Ensure:
	It uses wss for transport.
	Certificate paths match your Let’s Encrypt cert (if needed), e.g.:
	Cert: /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR_DOMAIN/cert.pem
	Key: /etc/letsencrypt/live/YOUR_DOMAIN/privkey.pem
	Save.
	vicidial-enable-webrtc.sh often updates this automatically, but verify it matches your domain and cert paths.
	
4- Rebuild conf file and reload asterisk and verify
